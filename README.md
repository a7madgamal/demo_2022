# Hi!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

This will run both the mock API server and the react app.
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

To run the tests. I would add much more tests if I had more time 🤷🏻‍♂️
